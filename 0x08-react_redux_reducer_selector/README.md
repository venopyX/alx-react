# React Redux Reducer and Selector Project

This project is part of the ALX React curriculum, focusing on implementing Redux reducers and selectors in a React application. The project emphasizes understanding the role of reducers, maintaining immutability, and using selectors for efficient state management.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Learn and apply Redux reducers and selectors in a React application.
- **Duration**: June 12, 2025, 6:00 AM to June 19, 2025, 6:00 AM
- **Review**: Manual QA review required upon completion.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the purpose and role of a reducer in an application.
- Understand the importance of keeping reducers pure and avoiding mutations.
- Use Immutable.js within reducers.
- Implement Normalizr for state normalization.
- Understand and use selectors for efficient state access.

## Requirements

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Node 14.x.x and npm 6.x.x
- **Files**: All files must end with a new line and include a `README.md` at the root.
- **Testing**: All functions must be exported and tested.

## Tasks

1. **Basic Reducer**: Implement a basic reducer for UI state management.
2. **Immutable Reducer**: Use Immutable.js to enhance the UI reducer.
3. **Course Reducer**: Create a reducer for managing course data.
4. **Notification Reducer**: Develop a reducer for handling notifications.
5. **Normalizr & Immutable**: Normalize data using Normalizr and update reducers to use Immutable.js.
6. **Selectors**: Create selectors for efficient state access in the notification reducer.
